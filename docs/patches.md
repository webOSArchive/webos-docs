# Patches

webOS was an extremely customizable operating system, with community created patches for a wide variety of modifications. Most of these Patches can still be found in Preware and should be installed from there, since they were created by contemporaneous developers. Information about what each Patch does can be found in Preware.

Newer patches don't benefit from the expertise of the original community, or the infrastructure that was created to deliver and support them, so will be discussed further here.
