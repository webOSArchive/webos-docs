# webOS Documentation Project

This project has two goals:

* Restore the on-device help system from archives, and get it working again
* Augment the on-device help with up-to-date information to re-activate a webOS device and make it useful on the modern Internet

The [Getting Started](activate.md) section will walk through the steps necessary to activate a webOS device (initially focused on the TouchPad), install some App Stores, and get on the modern web via a Proxy.

The [Next Steps](timesync.md) section covers some optional advanced topics that provide some quality-of-life improvements on webOS, through apps, hacks and scripts built by the community.
