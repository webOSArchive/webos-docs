# Activating a webOS Device

The Palm/HP activation services have been down a long time, but that doesn't mean your beautiful phone or tablet are dead! With a little effort, you can use the tools HP left behind to activate your device...

## Prepare Your Computer

This process works on Mac, Linux and Windows, but requires Java to be installed:

* Install Java (JDK) for Windows: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
* Install Java for Mac: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204036](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204036)
* Install Java for Linux: [https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)

Next you will need the Novacomm driver for your computer:

* Windows 32-bit (Tested on Windows 7): [Installer MSI](http://www.webosarchive.com/activation/drivers/novacom-win-32/)
* Windows 64-bit (Tested on Windows 10): [Installer MSI](http://www.webosarchive.com/activation/drivers/novacom-win-64/)
* macOS 32-bit (Tested up to Mojave): [Installer PKG](http://www.webosarchive.com/activation/drivers/novacom-mac/)
* macOS 64-bit (For Catalina and Later): [GitHub Release](https://github.com/incidentist/novacomd/releases/tag/macos64)
* Linux 32-bit (Tested on Ubunutu): [DEB Package](http://www.webosarchive.com/activation/drivers/novacom-linux-32/)
* Linux 64-bit (Tested on Ubunutu): [DEB Package](http://www.webosarchive.com/activation/drivers/novacom-linux-64/)

## Download the Tool

* [devicetool](http://www.webosarchive.com/activation/devicetool/devicetool.jar) For webOS 1.x Devices (Pre, Pixi, Pre Plus)
* [devicetool2](http://www.webosarchive.com/activation/devicetool/devicetool2.jar) For webOS 2.x and 3.x Devices (Pre 2, Pre3, Veer and TouchPad)
* [devicetool All-in-One](http://www.webosarchive.com/activation/devicetool/devicetoolAIO.jar) Community created all-in-one, works all of the above, plus TouchPad Go

## Prepare Your Device

Reboot your device into recovery mode...

### Phones

* Plug the USB cable into your computer. Do not connect the other end to your device yet.
* Remove the battery from the device.
* Hold down the device's volume up button.
* Insert the USB cable into the device.
* Re-insert the battery.
* Release the volume up button.

### TouchPad

* Hold the Power and Volume Up buttons until the TouchPad restarts
* Keep holding both buttons until you see the USB symbol

## Run the Activation Tool

You'll need a command line in your operating system of choice. On a Mac or Ubuntu, this is called Terminal. On Windows, press the Windows key and type "command" and hit enter.

* Using your command line, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Doctor tool.
* Run the command for the tool you downloaded: 
    + webOS 1.x: `java -jar devicetool.jar`
    + webOS 2+: `java -jar devicetool2.jar`
    + All-in-One: `java -jar devicetoolAIO.jar`
* Wait while the device is updated and rebooted

## Join WiFi

Once the device restarts, it will have bypassed activation, and you're ready to begin using it.<br>
Use the built-in settings to join your WiFi -- webOS works with 2.4ghz WiFi networks and all common wireless security schemes, including WPA.
